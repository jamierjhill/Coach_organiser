# Security Features Documentation

## Overview
This Tennis Match Organizer application has been enhanced with comprehensive security features to prevent abuse and protect against common web vulnerabilities.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Rate Limiting
- **IP-based rate limiting**: 20 requests per minute per IP for main endpoints
- **Endpoint-specific limits**: Different limits for CAPTCHA generation (10/min)
- **Automatic IP blocking**: IPs are blocked after suspicious patterns
- **Configurable thresholds**: Easy to adjust limits based on needs

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Enhanced form validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **CSV injection prevention**: Sanitizes dangerous characters (=, +, -, @, etc.)
- **XSS protection**: Input sanitization and output encoding
- **Length limits**: Prevents buffer overflow attacks
- **Pattern matching**: Validates input against expected formats

### 3. CAPTCHA System
- **Dual CAPTCHA types**: Image-based and math-based challenges
- **Automatic triggering**: Activates after 3 failed form submissions
- **Session-based validation**: Secure token-based verification
- **Refresh capability**: Users can get new challenges
- **Configurable expiry**: 5-minute timeout for CAPTCHA validity

### 4. Session Security
- **Secure session tokens**: SHA256-based session identification
- **Session validation**: Checks for token authenticity and expiry
- **24-hour session lifetime**: Automatic cleanup of old sessions
- **CSRF protection**: Tokens for state-changing operations
- **Session hijacking prevention**: IP-based session binding

### 5. Security Headers
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS and injection attacks
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME sniffing
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Browser-based XSS protection
- **HSTS**: Enforces HTTPS in production
- **Referrer Policy**: Controls referrer information

### 6. Bot Protection
- **Honeypot fields**: Hidden fields to detect automated submissions
- **User-agent validation**: Blocks known bot patterns
- **Request timing analysis**: Detects suspiciously fast requests
- **Behavioral analysis**: Tracks patterns indicating automation

### 7. Audit Logging
- **Comprehensive logging**: All security events are logged
- **Structured format**: JSON-formatted logs for analysis
- **Security events tracking**: Failed attempts, blocked IPs, violations
- **Performance monitoring**: Request timing and processing metrics
- **User action auditing**: Track all user interactions

### 8. IP Blocking & Monitoring
- **Automatic IP blocking**: Based on suspicious activity patterns
- **Multiple trigger conditions**:
  - 5+ validation failures
  - 50+ requests in short time
  - Bot-like submission patterns
- **Whitelist capability**: Can exempt trusted IPs
- **Manual block management**: Admin can block/unblock IPs

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
FLASK_ENV=production  # or development
FLASK_DEBUG=false     # set to true only in development
```

### Security Settings
Edit `security.py` to adjust:
- Rate limit thresholds
- CAPTCHA trigger points
- Session timeout durations
- IP blocking criteria

### Logging Configuration
Logs are written to `security.log` in the application directory:
- Security events
- Failed attempts
- Performance metrics
- Audit trail

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Security Status Endpoint
Access `/security/status` to check:
- Number of blocked IPs
- Active sessions count
- Rate limiting status

### Log Analysis
Regular review of `security.log` for:
- Repeated failed attempts
- Unusual access patterns
- Performance issues
- Security violations

### Cleanup Tasks
The system automatically:
- Cleans expired sessions (24 hours)
- Purges old rate limit data (1 hour)
- Removes stale security data

## Recommended Production Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
export FLASK_ENV=production
export FLASK_SECRET_KEY="$(python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex())')"
```

### 3. Run with Production Server
```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 app:app
```

### 4. Additional Security (Recommended)
- Use HTTPS/TLS certificates
- Set up fail2ban for additional IP blocking
- Configure firewall rules
- Regular security updates
- Monitor logs with SIEM tools

## Testing Security Features

### Rate Limiting Test
Make rapid requests to trigger rate limiting:
```bash
for i in {1..25}; do curl http://localhost:5000/; done
```

### CAPTCHA Trigger Test
1. Submit invalid forms 3+ times
2. CAPTCHA should appear
3. Test both image and math CAPTCHAs

### Input Validation Test
Try submitting:
- Very long names (>50 chars)
- Special characters (=, +, -, @)
- Script tags
- SQL injection attempts

## Security Incident Response

### If Attack Detected
1. Check `security.log` for details
2. Identify attack pattern
3. Block malicious IPs if needed
4. Review and adjust security thresholds
5. Update incident documentation

### Regular Security Review
- Weekly log analysis
- Monthly security configuration review
- Quarterly penetration testing
- Annual security audit

## Compliance Notes
- GDPR: No personal data stored without consent
- OWASP: Follows OWASP Top 10 guidelines
- Security headers: Industry standard implementation
- Data retention: Logs rotated and cleaned regularly
